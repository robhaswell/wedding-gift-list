      <h2 class="title">Gift information</h2>
      <p>We're enormously grateful for all the people who are insistent on giving us a gift for our wedding.
        As many of you know, we have both been home-making for a year, after puchasing a property together in April
        2017.
        This has been an incredible adventure, and is very much work-in progress!
        You can see a gallery of our renovation journey by clicking on our faces below:
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: center"><a href="javascript:openGallery()">
          <img src="img/house/selfie-outside.jpg" alt="Selfie outside the house" style="width: 10rem"><br />
          <span class="subtitle">Click to view our journey</span>
        </a></p>

      <p>Now however the adventure is paused because we are putting all our time and efforts into an amazing and
        unforgettable wedding party.
        We would like to continue building our dream home after the wedding.
        If you would like to honour us with a gift then a small donation to our home building fund would be wonderful
        and very kind.</p>
      <p>Your donation would go towards the bathroom floor which definitely needs replacing,
        stripping and painting the entire insides,
        and installing a bike shed out front and storage upstairs so that we can begin using the front room as a living
        area instead of a garage!</p>
      <p>We would gladly accept your gift in person or <a href="https://paypal.me/pools/c/88qtyiFLTF">via PayPal</a>.</p>
      <h2 class="title" style="margin-top: 0">Thank you!!</h2>
