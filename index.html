      <h2 class="title">Gift information</h2>
      <p>We're enormously grateful for all the people who have expressed interest in giving us a gift for our wedding.
        As many of you know, we have both been home-making for a year, after puchasing a property together in April
        2017.
        This has been an incredible adventure, and is very much work-in progress!
        You can see a gallery of our renovation journey by clicking on our faces below:
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: center"><a href="javascript:openGallery()">
          <img src="img/house/selfie-outside.jpg" alt="Selfie outside the house" style="width: 10rem"><br />
          <span class="subtitle">Click to view our journey</span>
        </a></p>

      <p>Now however the adventure is paused because we are putting all our time and efforts into an amazing and
        unforgettable wedding party.
        Unfortunately this means that we are unable to finish our dream home as we have run out of money.
        For this reason we ask that if you would like to honour us with a gift then we would be thrilled to accept a
        donation to the house fund.</p>
      <p>Your donation would go towards making the rear garden habitable for kittens &amp; children,
        and installing a bike shed and storage upstairs so that we can begin using the front room as a living area
        instead of a garage!</p>
      <p>We would gladly accept your gift in person or <a href="https://paypal.me/pools/c/88qtyiFLTF">via PayPal</a>.</p>
      <h2 class="title" style="margin-top: 0">Thank you!!</h2>
